Hi, I’m Ogunrinola Victoria Lara

 I’m currently learning Software Development with PLP Academy

 I’m looking to all the principles, methods and tools to 
     develop and maintain high quality sortware system.

 My classes so far are very interesting and interactive.

 I believe at the end of the programme an going to be
     one of the best in this August Cohort

 Am grateful to the Almight God who made it Possible
     and also to the organizer of this Programme for the priviledge.
